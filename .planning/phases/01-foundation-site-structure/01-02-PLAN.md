<objective>
Define Markdown front matter schema and create content structure templates for case studies.

Purpose: Establish consistent metadata structure for case studies so they render correctly with templates and enable future filtering/organization by the three pillars (complex problem-solving, AI integration, UX research).

Output: Case study template files, documented YAML front matter schema, and example case study demonstrating the structure.

**Key findings from research:**
- YAML front matter is standard for static site generators
- Case study structure should include: title, date, summary, role, duration, pillars, featured_image, impact metrics
- Metadata drives template rendering and future filtering
- Don't hand-roll content structure - use consistent schema across all case studies

**From 01-01 execution:**
- Hugo project initialized, templates ready
- Pillar taxonomy added for filtering
- Base single.html template exists for case study pages

**Design requirements:**
- Three pillars should be implicit, not explicit labels
- Metadata must support case study preview cards on homepage
- Front matter must enable "at-a-glance" scanning for recruiters

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Define and document YAML front matter schema</name>
  <files>content/CASE_STUDY_SCHEMA.md</files>
  <action>
    1. Create content/CASE_STUDY_SCHEMA.md documenting the required front matter structure
    2. Define these required fields:
       - title (string): Project name/title
       - date (YYYY-MM-DD): Project completion/launch date
       - summary (string, 1-2 sentences): Quick description of what was built and outcome
       - role (string): Your role on the project (e.g., "Lead UX Designer", "Product Designer")
       - team_size (integer): Number of people on the team
       - duration (string): Project duration (e.g., "4 months", "Q2 2024")
       - featured (boolean): true if should appear on homepage, false otherwise
       - featured_image (string): Path to hero image (e.g., "images/hero.jpg")
       - featured_order (integer): 1-3 for homepage display order
       - pillars (array): One or more of ["complex-problem-solving", "ai-integration", "ux-research"]
    3. Define optional fields:
       - impact (array of strings): Key metrics or outcomes (e.g., "40% reduction in setup time")
       - tags (array): Other relevant tags for future organization
    4. Show example front matter block
    5. Include rationale: which fields enable filtering, which enable homepage previews, which support recruiter scanning
    Rationale: Explicit schema prevents inconsistency across case studies. Schema drives both template rendering and future features (filtering by pillar, etc.).
    Avoid: Don't create overly complex metadata. Keep it focused on what Phase 2-3 (homepage/case studies) actually needs.

    - content/CASE_STUDY_SCHEMA.md exists and is readable

  <name>Task 2: Create case study archetype template</name>
  <files>content/projects/_template.md</files>
  <action>
    1. Create content/projects/_template.md as an archetype/template for new case studies
    2. Include complete front matter with all required and optional fields
    3. Include basic Markdown structure sections with comments:
       ## Problem & Context
       [Describe the challenge, user problem, context]

       ## Approach & Research
       [Explain your design process, research methods used - signals "UX research" pillar]

       ## Solution & Implementation
       [Describe the solution, design decisions - signals "complex problem-solving" pillar]

       ## Results & Impact
       [Outcomes, metrics, how it went - back to evidence]

       [Optional: How AI was integrated - signals "ai-integration" pillar]
    4. Include inline comments explaining what content goes where and why
    Rationale: Template ensures consistent structure across all three case studies. Section names map to the three pillars implicitly (research → UX research, solution → complex problem-solving, impact/AI → AI integration).
    Avoid: Don't prescribe exact word counts or tone - that's author's choice. Just establish structural consistency.

  <verify>

  <name>Task 3: Create initial case study directories and test structure</name>
  <files>content/projects/project-1/index.md, content/projects/project-2/index.md, content/projects/project-3/index.md, content/projects/project-1/images/.gitkeep, content/projects/project-2/images/.gitkeep, content/projects/project-3/images/.gitkeep</files>
  <action>
    1. Create three project directories: content/projects/project-1/, content/projects/project-2/, content/projects/project-3/
    2. In each directory, create index.md with:
       - Complete front matter (use _template.md as reference)
       - Placeholder content: "Case study content coming soon" or similar
       - Set featured: false for now (Phase 3 will set to true and add real content)
       - Set featured_image to placeholder path
       - Set pillars to all three: ["complex-problem-solving", "ai-integration", "ux-research"] (Phase 3 can adjust)
    3. Create images/ subdirectories in each project folder with .gitkeep placeholder
    4. Test that Hugo build still succeeds and generates project pages
    5. Verify Hugo list.html template renders the three projects correctly
    Rationale: Placeholder projects let us verify the template system works before content is written. Images/ directories ready for Phase 3 image imports.
    Avoid: Don't write actual case study content yet - Phase 3 is responsible for that. Just create structure and placeholders.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Three project directories exist: content/projects/project-{1,2,3}/
    - Each has index.md with valid YAML front matter following schema
    - Each has images/ subdirectory
    - `hugo build` completes without errors
    - Project pages are generated in public/projects/
    - Project listing renders (verify in list template output)
  </verify>
  <done>Case study directories initialized, structure tested, ready for Phase 3 content creation</done>

# Phase 1 Plan 2: Content Structure & Schema Summary

**Markdown front matter schema defined, case study template created, directory structure initialized**

## Accomplishments

- YAML front matter schema documented with all required/optional fields
- Case study archetype template created with explanatory comments
- Section structure designed to implicitly signal three pillars
- Three project directories initialized with placeholder content
- Images directories created for Phase 3 image assets
- Schema verified with working examples in three placeholder projects
- Hugo rendering verified with placeholder projects

## Files Created/Modified

- `content/CASE_STUDY_SCHEMA.md` - Comprehensive front matter documentation
- `content/projects/_template.md` - Case study archetype template
- `content/projects/project-1/index.md` - Placeholder project 1
- `content/projects/project-2/index.md` - Placeholder project 2
- `content/projects/project-3/index.md` - Placeholder project 3
- `content/projects/project-{1,2,3}/images/.gitkeep` - Image directory placeholders

## Decisions Made

- **Front matter fields:** Minimum required set chosen to enable homepage previews, filtering, and recruiter scannability
- **Section structure:** Problem → Research → Solution → Results (implicitly signals pillars)
- **Pillar signaling:** Research section emphasizes UX research, solution section emphasizes problem-solving, impact/AI section emphasizes AI integration
- **Placeholder approach:** Three projects created with placeholders to verify structure before Phase 3 content creation

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

✅ **Ready for Phase 01-03:** Markdown content structure is complete and Hugo rendering verified. Deployment pipeline can now be configured.

⚠️ **Awaiting Phase 3:** Actual case study content will populate project-1/2/3 directories. Schema and template provide framework for consistent structure.
