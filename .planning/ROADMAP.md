# Roadmap: JM Case Studies Portfolio

## Overview

A clean, minimal portfolio site built on Markdown-driven content and static generation. Phase 1 establishes the technical foundation and content structure. Phase 2 designs and implements the homepage with compelling project overview and prominent contact CTA. Phase 3 fleshes out three detailed case studies that implicitly demonstrate complex problem-solving, AI integration, and UX research. Phase 4 polishes the design, optimizes for performance, and launches on GitHub Pages.

## Domain Expertise

None — this is a pure frontend/design project leveraging standard web patterns.

## Phases

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation & Site Structure** - Set up static site architecture, template system, Markdown content structure, and deployment pipeline
- [ ] **Phase 2: Homepage Design & Implementation** - Build homepage with 3-project overview cards, contact CTA, and clean minimal design system
- [ ] **Phase 3: Case Studies** - Create three detailed case studies demonstrating complex problem-solving, AI, and UX research methodologies
- [ ] **Phase 4: Polish & Launch** - Design refinements, typography optimization, accessibility review, and GitHub Pages deployment

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation & Site Structure
**Goal**: Establish technical foundation and content management system for the portfolio.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Research**: Likely (static site generator choice, Markdown structure for case studies)
**Research topics**: Static site generator options (Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, Next.js) compatible with GitHub Pages; Markdown front matter structure for case study metadata
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01: Choose static site generator and set up project structure
- [ ] 01-02: Design Markdown content structure and template system for case studies
- [ ] 01-03: Configure GitHub Pages deployment and build pipeline

### Phase 2: Homepage Design & Implementation
**Goal**: Build compelling homepage with 3-project overview and prominent contact CTA.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Research**: Unlikely (design system and component patterns from phase 1)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: Design homepage layout—hero, 3-project card overview, contact CTA positioning
- [ ] 02-02: Implement responsive layout with clean typography and whitespace hierarchy
- [ ] 02-03: Add interactive elements (hover states, smooth scrolling) and finalize visual polish

### Phase 3: Case Studies
**Goal**: Create three detailed case studies that implicitly demonstrate the three pillars: complex problem-solving, AI, UX research.
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Research**: Unlikely (content creation, follows established Markdown/template structure from phase 1)
**Plans**: TBD (one per case study)

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01: Case Study 1 — Research, problem-solving narrative, outcomes
- [ ] 03-02: Case Study 2 — Research, problem-solving narrative, outcomes
- [ ] 03-03: Case Study 3 — Research, problem-solving narrative, outcomes

### Phase 4: Polish & Launch
**Goal**: Final refinements, accessibility, performance optimization, and live deployment.
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Research**: Unlikely (standard web best practices)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01: Typography refinement, responsive testing, accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] 04-02: Performance optimization and GitHub Pages launch
