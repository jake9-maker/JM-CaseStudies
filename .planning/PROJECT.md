# JM Case Studies Portfolio

## What This Is

A clean, minimal, and bold portfolio site showcasing three flagship UX design projects that demonstrate complex problem-solving, AI integration, and UX research methodologies. Designed for recruiters to quickly grasp your expertise and contact you directly—with enough compelling overview that deeper dives into case studies are optional, not necessary.

## Core Value

Recruiters immediately understand you solve complex problems through AI and research-driven design, then can contact you with one click.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Homepage with 3-project overview that demonstrates complex problem-solving, AI, and UX research implicitly through content
- [ ] Contact call-to-action prominently placed and easily discoverable throughout the site
- [ ] Three detailed case studies (with enough preview on overview to avoid mandatory deep dives)
- [ ] Clean, minimal design with whitespace-driven typography and strategic use of bold visuals and scale
- [ ] Content structure filters through lens of three pillars: complex problem-solving, AI, UX research
- [ ] Markdown-based content management (no CMS)
- [ ] GitHub Pages compatible for hosting

### Out of Scope

- Blog or writing samples — Focus is on portfolio work, not thought leadership (v2 consideration)
- Interactive tools or experiments — Content and case studies are the focus (v2 if relevant)
- Social media links/integrations — Nice-to-have, not required for v1
- Multiple case study detail variations — All case studies follow consistent depth/structure
- Testimonials section — Not a priority for v1; can add if project validation shows value

## Context

**Target Audience:**
- Primary: Recruiters (need quick scan, clear contact path, impressive overview)
- Secondary: Professionals/peers (deeper understanding of your design process and thinking)

**Design Philosophy:**
- Content is the protagonist; site scaffolding is invisible
- Whitespace as breathing room for content to stand out
- Typography communicates hierarchy and context
- Bold color, high contrast, and strategic scale emphasize the work, not the design system
- Everything hierarchy-driven toward contact CTA

**Content Approach:**
- Three pillars (complex problem-solving, AI, UX research) are implicit—visible through examples and case study framing, not explicit labels
- Case study overview on homepage compelling enough that CTAs (contact, deeper dives) are optional, not mandatory
- All content digestible "at a glance" for busy recruiters

## Constraints

- **No CMS**: Markdown-based content for simplicity and scalability
- **GitHub Pages hosting**: No server-side dependencies, static-only
- **No paid services**: Budget constraint means free hosting and tools only
- **Simplicity first**: All decisions prioritize scalability and simplicity over features

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Markdown + static site | Aligns with "simple and scalable"; no CMS cost; GitHub Pages compatible | — Pending |
| Implicit pillar presentation | Recruiters should experience your thinking through your work, not read about it | — Pending |
| 3 projects maximum | Highly curated; respects recruiter time; quality over quantity | — Pending |
| Contact as primary CTA | Recruiter's ultimate goal; everything else is supporting context | — Pending |
