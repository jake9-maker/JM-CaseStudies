## 60-Second Summary (TL;DR)

- **The outcome:** Discovered that Max appraisal and ClearCar (separate consumer-facing experiences) were 80% redundant with only cosmetic differences. By auditing both platforms, identifying the 20% of unique, valuable capabilities in ClearCar, and proposing a strategic consolidation to leadership, I created a roadmap to merge the experiences, sunset ClearCar, and reallocate significant engineering capacity to larger strategic initiatives.
- **Why it mattered:** Engineering capacity was trapped in maintaining two nearly-identical platforms. The company was paying for duplication without strategic benefit. Consolidation would free resources while improving dealer experience by unifying the appraisal journey.
- **What I did:** Conducted comprehensive audits (jobs to be done, user personas, user journeys) across Max and ClearCar. Interviewed users, mapped redundancies, identified the 20% unique value in ClearCar. Designed and prototyped the merged experience. Facilitated stakeholder alignment and presented business case to executive leadership.
- **Proof:** Audit identified 20% of ClearCar capabilities worth preserving (the other 80% redundant). Executive leadership approved consolidation roadmap for 2026 execution. I'm spearheading the 2026 consolidation based on audit findings and cross-platform expertise.

## Overview (Impact-First)

- **Primary Impact:** Eliminated strategic waste (two nearly-identical platforms consuming engineering resources) and unlocked significant capacity for larger initiatives by consolidating to a single, unified appraisal experience. This project demonstrates the value of cross-platform thinking and rigorous auditing.
- **Secondary Impacts:**
  - Improved dealer experience by unifying the appraisal journey (instead of maintaining two separate, confusing experiences).
  - Established an auditing methodology (jobs to be done, user personas, user journeys) that's now being applied to other product consolidation opportunities.
  - Proved the business case for strategic product rationalization—sometimes the best product decision is *removing* products, not building new ones.
  - Positioned me as a cross-platform strategist (now owning or supporting 8+ product lines across the company).
- **Role:** Product Designer, Auditor, and Lead Researcher. Owned audit strategy, user research, problem framing, experience design, stakeholder facilitation, and communication with executive leadership across 15-person cross-functional team (Vehicle Intelligence, ClearCar, Max Inventory, Max Appraisal).
- **Timeframe:** 1 year of audit, research, and strategy work. 2026 execution of consolidation (pending, not yet launched).
- **Scope:** 15-person team spanning Vehicle Intelligence, ClearCar, Max Inventory, and appraisal management. Affected consumer-facing appraisal experiences, dealer platforms, back-end inventory services, and executive strategy.
- **Why This Is Hard:** Product consolidation requires fighting organizational inertia. Teams are invested in their products. Leadership is risk-averse about "sunsetting" things. You have to prove with rigor (not opinion) that consolidation is better, then facilitate alignment across teams with different incentives. This requires deep research, clear communication, and political skill.

---

## Why Leadership Needed Proof

- **Executive mandate:** CFO and VP of Product were concerned about engineering capacity being fragmented across too many initiatives. They asked: are we building the right portfolio of products, or are we maintaining legacy products that could be consolidated?
- **What decision this unlocked:** Whether to continue funding two separate appraisal experiences or consolidate them. This required proof that the experiences were truly redundant (not just similar), that consolidation wouldn't lose strategic value, and that the engineering payoff was worth the effort.
- **Why existing approach was insufficient:** Superficially, Max and ClearCar looked different (different branding, different teams). But leadership couldn't tell if the differences were meaningful or cosmetic. We needed a rigorous audit to answer: what's truly unique about each? What's worth keeping? What's waste?

---

## The Real Problem (Not the Obvious One)

- **Surface problem everyone talked about:** "We have two appraisal experiences. Should we consolidate them?"
- **The problem I uncovered through research:** We had two *nearly identical* experiences with cosmetic differences, maintained by separate teams with separate incentives. Neither team was optimizing for the dealer; they were optimizing to maintain their own product. The result was redundant features, fragmented user experience, and wasted engineering capacity. Consolidation wasn't optional—it was strategic necessity.
- **Organizational risk if nothing changed:** Engineering would continue to be fragmented across two products. New features would have to be built twice. Bugs would have to be fixed twice. Dealer confusion would persist (two different interfaces for almost the same function). The company would miss opportunities to reinvest engineering capacity in larger strategic initiatives (inventory management, vehicle intelligence, pricing optimization).

---

## Operating Model We Proved

**Strategy:** *Don't default to "keep both." Default to "audit ruthlessly and consolidate what's redundant." Preserve unique value, eliminate waste.*

The mental model: Product portfolios naturally accumulate redundancy over time. Teams build similar things independently, then organizational inertia prevents consolidation. The solution is rigorous auditing that separates signal (unique value) from noise (redundant features). Once you quantify the redundancy (80% in this case), consolidation becomes obvious, not debatable.

This replaced the "keep both products to keep both teams happy" approach with "consolidate ruthlessly, reallocate resources strategically."

## The 3 Decisions That Drove the Outcome

### Decision 1: Conduct Comprehensive Audits Using Jobs to Be Done, User Personas, and User Journeys

**Problem it solved:** Leadership couldn't assess consolidation value without clear data. "Max and ClearCar look similar" was opinion. We needed rigorous evidence of what was truly redundant vs. unique. This required systematic auditing across multiple dimensions.

**Options considered:**
1. Quick comparison (list features, note overlaps)—fast but superficial; leadership might not be convinced.
2. Survey dealers and users about each platform—valuable input, but doesn't provide systematic analysis of the product structure.
3. Comprehensive audit using jobs to be done (what are dealers trying to accomplish?), user personas (who uses each platform?), and user journeys (how do they navigate each?)—time-intensive but provides rigorous, defensible analysis.

**Tradeoff accepted:** We invested significant time in the audit (several weeks across a 3-person research team). This delayed the business case, but it created undeniable evidence that leadership couldn't dismiss as opinion. The alternative (quick comparison) would have left room for debate.

**Decision:** Conduct systematic audits using jobs to be done, user personas, and user journeys. Map these across both Max and ClearCar. Identify overlaps and unique capabilities. Quantify redundancy.

**Why this worked:** The audits revealed clear patterns. Max and ClearCar served the same jobs (appraisal for dealers), served the same personas (dealer appraisers, inventory managers), and followed nearly identical user journeys. The 80/20 split (80% redundant, 20% unique) emerged naturally from the data, not from opinion.

**Proof:** Audit documentation clearly showed redundancy across feature sets, user flows, and data models. When presented to executive leadership, the evidence was overwhelming—nobody could argue with the data. Consolidation became the obvious decision.

### Decision 2: Identify and Preserve the 20% of Unique Capabilities in ClearCar

**Problem it solved:** If consolidation was going to happen, we couldn't just eliminate ClearCar entirely—that would lose whatever unique value it provided. We needed to identify what was worth preserving, merge those capabilities into Max, then sunset ClearCar. This required careful analysis of which features were truly unique vs. just styled differently.

**Options considered:**
1. Merge all of Max and ClearCar features (union of both)—comprehensive but bloated; loses the simplicity that made consolidation appealing.
2. Keep only Max features, sunset ClearCar entirely—fast, but loses unique capabilities that might be valuable.
3. Identify the 20% of ClearCar features that were genuinely unique/valuable, merge those into Max, and sunset the rest—strategic; preserves value while consolidating.

**Tradeoff accepted:** We invested extra research effort to identify which ClearCar features were truly unique (vs. stylistically different). This meant deeper user interviews and feature analysis, but it ensured we didn't lose anything valuable in consolidation.

**Decision:** For each ClearCar feature, determine: (1) Is this present in Max? (2) If not, is it valuable and worth preserving? (3) Can we merge it into Max without bloating the experience? Document the 20% of capabilities worth preserving and design how they integrate into Max.

**Why this worked:** The analysis revealed that most ClearCar features were rebranded versions of Max features (redundant). But a few were genuinely unique: specific appraisal workflows that dealers on the ClearCar platform preferred, certain data views that ClearCar surface better than Max. By identifying these 20%, we could preserve value while consolidating.

**Proof:** The preserved 20% included workflow optimizations and data views that Max didn't offer. When prototyped as part of the merged Max experience, dealers responded positively—they saw the consolidation as an *improvement*, not a loss.

### Decision 3: Design and Prototype the Merged Experience Before Executive Presentation

**Problem it solved:** Telling leadership "we should consolidate Max and ClearCar" is abstract. Showing them "here's what the merged experience looks like, with the best of both" is concrete and compelling. We needed a prototype to make the vision tangible.

**Options considered:**
1. Present the consolidation strategy with wireframes only—leadership gets the idea, but might not be convinced the merged experience would be good.
2. Build a full prototype of the merged experience—expensive and time-consuming before approval.
3. Build a mid-fidelity interactive prototype showing the merged experience, focusing on the workflows that preserve ClearCar's unique capabilities—demonstrates the vision without full engineering investment.

**Tradeoff accepted:** We invested in designing and prototyping the merged experience at higher fidelity than typical conceptual work. This added design time, but it gave leadership confidence that the consolidation would actually improve the experience, not degrade it.

**Decision:** Design the merged appraisal experience with Max as the base, integrating the 20% of ClearCar's unique capabilities. Build an interactive prototype demonstrating key workflows. Use this to show leadership what dealers would experience post-consolidation.

**Why this worked:** The prototype answered leadership's implicit question: "Will consolidation break the experience?" By showing a thoughtfully merged experience that preserved unique value and simplified the overall product, we demonstrated that consolidation was not a cost-cutting exercise—it was a *strategic improvement*.

**Proof:** Leadership feedback on the prototype was uniformly positive. They saw the value in consolidation and approved the 2026 roadmap based on the prototype. The prototype became the design spec for the 2026 engineering work.

## Evidence and Validation

**Quantitative signals:**
- Feature overlap analysis: 80% of ClearCar features present (in some form) in Max; only 20% unique.
- User journey alignment: 90%+ of dealer workflows were identical across Max and ClearCar.
- Engineering capacity saved: Consolidation estimated to free 3–4 FTE of engineering capacity currently split between maintaining two platforms.
- Cost of duplication: Estimated 15–20% of engineering budget for appraisal was spent maintaining redundancy.

**Qualitative signals:**
- Dealer feedback: "Why do I have to learn two different interfaces for the same thing?" (revealed confusion caused by redundancy).
- Executive feedback: Consolidation roadmap approved unanimously; viewed as strategic win for prioritizing larger initiatives.
- Team feedback: Teams that initially resisted consolidation acknowledged the audit findings were rigorous and undeniable.

**What would not have happened without this work:**
- Engineering capacity would continue to be fragmented across two nearly-identical platforms.
- Dealers would continue to experience confusion from two separate appraisal experiences.
- Company would miss opportunities to reallocate engineering to larger strategic initiatives.
- The audit methodology (jobs to be done, user personas, user journeys) wouldn't have been established for future consolidation opportunities.

## Constraints That Shaped the Work

- **Organizational inertia:** Both Max and ClearCar had teams invested in their products. Proposing consolidation meant asking teams to accept sunsetting their product. We had to use data to overcome emotional attachment and build consensus.
- **Cross-platform complexity:** Max and ClearCar were built on different technical stacks, served different user personas (inventory managers for Max, appraisers for ClearCar), and had different feature priorities. Auditing meant understanding both deeply before recommending consolidation.
- **Executive skepticism:** Leadership was cautious about "killing" a product. We had to prove that consolidation wasn't about cost-cutting, but about strategic rationalization and capability preservation.
- **Timeline for execution:** The audit happened over several months, but execution is planned for 2026. This means maintaining both platforms in their current state while engineering prepares for consolidation—a period of limbo that tests organizational discipline.

## What This Enabled Next

- **Immediate follow-on:** 2026 consolidation roadmap is approved and staffed. I'm spearheading the 2026 execution.
- **Audit methodology:** The jobs to be done + user personas + user journeys approach is now being applied to other product consolidation opportunities (other platforms are being assessed for redundancy).
- **Strategic capacity:** Freed engineering capacity is being reallocated to larger initiatives (vehicle intelligence enhancements, inventory management improvements, pricing optimization).
- **Broader platform leadership:** This project positioned me as a cross-platform strategist. I now own or support 8+ product lines across the company: transportation, private auctions, marketplace, seller/buyer experiences, consumer/lead gen, vehicle intelligence, inventory management, CMS, IMS, and recently, pricing auditing across the entire business.

## Reflection (Forward-Looking)

- **Capability unlocked:** I learned that sometimes the most strategic product decision is *not* building something new—it's eliminating redundancy and consolidating ruthlessly. This requires different thinking than typical product work (which is usually additive). Consolidation is harder, less glamorous, but often higher-impact.
- **How this changed my approach:** I now ask "Is this product truly unique, or is it solving a problem we've already solved?" before investing in new products. I look for redundancy across the portfolio and flag consolidation opportunities. This shifts from "what should we build?" to "what should we *rationalize*?"
- **What kinds of problems I now look for:** Product portfolios with redundancy. Teams maintaining similar products independently. Engineering capacity fragmented across near-duplicate efforts. These are high-leverage consolidation opportunities that free resources for strategic initiatives.
- **Cross-platform thinking:** This project required understanding 8+ different product lines, how they relate, where they overlap, and where they complement each other. I earned the right to work across many different platforms because I can see the connections and inefficiencies that siloed thinking misses.
- **Leadership and communication:** Consolidation requires more communication and facilitation than building new products. You have to bring stakeholders with competing interests to alignment. This project taught me that communication and facilitation are as important as design and research.
