## 60-Second Summary (TL;DR)

- **The outcome:** Dealers were losing money and time relaunching vehicles that failed guarantee sales at lower prices. By integrating guarantee sale as a seamless alternative within the wholesale auction workflow, we digitized a manual process and achieved 10x growth in successfully launched guarantee vehicles in under a year.
- **Why it mattered:** Dealers need speed to profitability. Time spent relaunching vehicles is time not spent on the lot selling other inventory. Guarantee sales move vehicles fast—but the friction of the existing process meant dealers were opting out, leaving money on the table for the company and the platform.
- **What I did:** Led end-to-end strategy, research, design, and cross-functional coordination. Discovered that the real opportunity was positioning guarantee sale as a *natural next step* in the wholesale auction flow, not as a separate product. Owned product vision, designer partnerships, and communication across 12-person team.
- **Proof:** 10x growth in successfully launched guarantee vehicles in under a year. Created the company's first white-label component system (now being replicated by design team). Guarantee Sale is expanding to trade-ins and retail in 2026, with me spearheading the expansion.

## Overview (Impact-First)

- **Primary Impact:** Eliminated the friction between failed guarantee sales and the decision to relaunch at lower price. By making guarantee sale a built-in alternative within the auction workflow, we removed a manual, cognitive decision and turned it into a seamless digital process. This unlocked massive growth.
- **Secondary Impacts:**
  - Converted a manual, team-dependent process into a digitized, scalable system (manual team now handles exceptions, not standard flow).
  - Established the company's first white-label component framework—now being adopted across design teams.
  - Created a repeatable pattern for launching new product integrations (now applied to upcoming trade-in and retail guarantee sales).
  - Increased dealer retention and satisfaction—dealers see us as enabling their profitability, not just taking a transaction fee.
- **Role:** Product Lead Designer; owned strategy, research, problem framing, design direction, product ownership, team coordination, and cross-functional communication across product, design, research, engineering, analytics, and sales.
- **Timeframe:** 1 year from concept to 10x growth (ongoing expansion into 2026).
- **Scope:** 12-person team including myself, product designer, lead researcher, product researcher, product owner, product manager, analytics specialist, small engineering team, and 3 manual pricing specialists (whose work was digitized).
- **Why This Is Hard:** Guarantee sales have manual pricing logic embedded in dealer behavior and specialist knowledge. Digitizing required understanding not just the happy-path workflow, but the pricing decision logic, risk management, and dealer psychology around "cutting your losses" and relaunching. Then we had to make it feel natural, not like a system forcing a decision.

---

## Why Leadership Needed Proof

- **Executive mandate:** Company revenue comes from volume and velocity. Guarantee sales are high-profit transactions, but they were being left on the table because dealers found the process too friction-heavy. Finance and leadership asked: can we unlock this revenue without breaking the dealer experience?
- **What decision this unlocked:** Whether to invest in digitizing a manual, specialist-dependent process (uncertain ROI, risk of automation failures) or accept that guarantee sales would remain a niche product. This required evidence that dealers actually *wanted* faster guarantee sale workflows, and that digitization could handle the pricing complexity.
- **Why existing approach was insufficient:** The existing process relied on 3 manual pricing specialists who evaluated failed auctions, calculated optimal relaunch prices, and worked with dealers to decide. This process didn't scale. Each specialist could handle a fixed number of cases; adding volume meant adding headcount. The company needed a scalable solution that preserved decision quality while removing the manual bottleneck.

## The Real Problem (Not the Obvious One)

- **Surface problem everyone talked about:** "Guarantee sales are underperforming; dealers don't understand the process. We need better education and communication."
- **The problem I uncovered through research:** Dealers *understood* guarantee sales perfectly—they understood that when a vehicle doesn't sell at guarantee price, they have to relaunch at a lower price. But that decision was *cognitively expensive* and *emotionally hard*. "I'm taking a loss on this vehicle" is not fun. Dealers avoided the decision, which meant avoiding guarantee sales altogether. Education wouldn't fix this; workflow redesign would.
- **Organizational risk if nothing changed:** Guarantee sales would remain a low-adoption niche product. Revenue opportunity would be left on the table. Dealers would stick with traditional auction paths, where the company earns less profit. Competitors might discover the opportunity and build a better workflow first, creating differentiation pressure.

## Operating Model We Proved

**Strategy:** *Make guarantee sale the natural next step, not an additional decision. Reduce cognitive load by embedding the choice into workflow. Let the system guide instead of requiring the dealer to evaluate.*

The mental model: Dealers don't avoid guarantee sales because they don't want the outcome. They avoid them because the *decision process* is painful. By making guarantee sale appear as a natural option (alongside the standard relaunch at lower price), we let dealers compare outcomes without the friction of a separate process. The decision becomes "which is better for me?"—not "do I want to use this separate product?"

This replaced the "educate dealers about guarantee sale" approach with "make guarantee sale unavoidable and easy."

## The 3 Decisions That Drove the Outcome

### Decision 1: Integrate Guarantee Sale Into the Wholesale Auction Workflow, Not as a Separate Path

**Problem it solved:** Guarantee sale was positioned as an alternative product, requiring dealers to opt-in, find it in navigation, and make a separate decision. This separation created friction. Most dealers never discovered it or didn't want to deal with another flow. We needed guarantee sale to appear at the moment when dealers were already deciding what to do with a failed auction.

**Options considered:**
1. Improve guarantee sale visibility (better marketing, emails, onboarding)—easier to implement but doesn't address the core friction of a separate decision process.
2. Require all dealers to use guarantee sale for failed auctions—high adoption but removes dealer choice, risks resentment.
3. Integrate guarantee sale as a natural option *within* the failed-auction workflow: show dealers what happens if they relaunch at lower price vs. what happens if they guarantee sale. Let them choose the path that fits their goal.

**Tradeoff accepted:** We invested in workflow integration that required tight product and engineering coordination. This was more complex than just improving marketing, but it fundamentally changed how dealers experienced the product. The alternative (marketing) would have yielded marginal improvements; integration yielded 10x growth.

**Decision:** When an auction fails to meet reserve, surface both paths to the dealer: (1) relaunch at lower price with estimated price and timeline, (2) guarantee sale with payout and timeline. Make the comparison transparent. Let dealers decide.

**Why this worked:** Dealers saw guarantee sale at the moment of decision, when they were already evaluating options. No additional navigation required. The comparison framing made the choice obvious—guarantee sale usually moved faster and provided predictable payout. Adoption jumped because the decision was now informed and effortless.

**Proof:** Before integration, ~2% of failed auctions resulted in guarantee sales. After integration, ~28% of failed auctions resulted in guarantee sales in the first quarter (14x initial adoption lift). This demonstrated massive latent demand once friction was removed.

### Decision 2: Digitize the Manual Pricing Logic Without Losing Risk Management

**Problem it solved:** The 3 manual pricing specialists who handled guarantee sales made complex pricing decisions: how much should a guarantee sale payout be to ensure it moves? What pricing maximizes the company's margin while delivering value to the dealer? This logic was in their heads, embedded in experience. Digitizing meant extracting that logic and encoding it into rules, without losing the nuance or creating opportunities for bad decisions.

**Options considered:**
1. Simple rules (e.g., "payout = 70% of auction reserve")—easy to implement but inflexible and would leave money on the table.
2. Keep specialists in the loop (digitized intake, specialist decides payout)—scales better than fully manual, but still relies on specialist capacity.
3. Machine-learned pricing model trained on historical specialist decisions + market data. Specialists review and adjust edge cases; model handles standard flow.

**Tradeoff accepted:** We invested in building an ML-lite pricing model that learned from specialist decisions. This added complexity and required ongoing model monitoring, but freed specialists to focus on exceptions and risk management instead of routine pricing. The model also meant we could scale without adding specialists.

**Decision:** Build a pricing recommendation engine based on vehicle type, condition, market demand, and timing. Specialists train the model and approve edge cases. Dealers see recommended payout; specialists monitor for anomalies; system suggests, specialists validate.

**Why this worked:** The system handled 95% of cases automatically, freeing specialists to focus on complex vehicles and market anomalies. Dealers got fast decisions (seconds vs. hours of waiting for specialist review). The company gained visibility into pricing patterns and could optimize margin dynamically.

**Proof:** Manual process took 4–8 hours per vehicle (specialist intake, pricing decision, dealer communication). Digitized process took <5 minutes for 95% of cases. Turnaround time dropped from 1–2 days to <1 hour. Specialist team capacity increased 15x (from handling ~30 cases/week to monitoring exceptions across 450+ cases/week).

### Decision 3: Create the First White-Label Component System to Enable Replication and Scale

**Problem it solved:** As guarantee sale grew, we knew we'd want to expand it to trade-ins and retail. We also knew other teams would want similar integrations. We needed a component system that was reusable, maintainable, and didn't require rebuilding for each new surface or product variant. But we didn't have a design system for white-label components—we were inventing it as we went.

**Options considered:**
1. Build guarantee sale monolithically (custom for auction workflow)—fast to launch, hard to replicate or maintain.
2. Build components, but ad-hoc without system thinking—components exist, but inconsistently, making handoff to other teams difficult.
3. Design a white-label component system from the ground up: define component structure, API, theming, edge-case handling. Make it replicable and documented so other teams can use it for their integrations.

**Tradeoff accepted:** We invested significant time upfront in component system design. This delayed the initial guarantee sale launch by ~3 weeks, but it created a foundation that made trade-in and retail integration faster and more predictable. The alternative (monolithic build) would have gotten us to launch faster, but would have created technical debt that would slow future expansions.

**Decision:** Design guarantee sale as a component system: separate concerns (pricing logic, UI, workflow, data models), create clear interfaces, document thoroughly. Make it the template for future integrations (trade-in, retail, other products).

**Why this worked:** Design team can now replicate the component system for other integrations without reinventing the architecture. Handoff to other teams is clean because the system is documented and modular. Maintenance is easier because components are decoupled. New product variants can reuse components instead of rebuilding.

**Proof:** After guarantee sale launched, trade-in and retail guarantee sale designs were estimated to take 20+ weeks. Using the white-label component system, both are now on track for <10 weeks (50% faster). The design team has since applied the white-label approach to 3 other product integrations, establishing it as a company standard.

## Evidence and Validation

**Quantitative signals:**
- Successfully launched guarantee vehicles: 10x growth in under 1 year (scale from baseline ~30/week to 300+/week).
- Guarantee sale adoption rate: ~2% of failed auctions (before) → ~28% (90 days after integration) → stabilized at ~32% (current).
- Manual process digitization: 95% of cases now handled automatically; specialist team reduced from intake focus to exception handling and model monitoring.
- Turnaround time: 1–2 days (manual) → <1 hour (digitized).
- Company margin: Guarantee sales deliver 18–22% margin (vs. 8–12% for traditional auction relaunches); 10x volume increase = significant revenue impact.

**Qualitative signals:**
- Dealer feedback: "Guarantee sale used to feel like a separate thing; now it's just the natural choice when an auction fails."
- Specialist team feedback: Transitioned from high-volume intake work to strategic analysis and model monitoring; team satisfaction increased.
- Design team feedback: White-label component system adopted as standard approach; "Now we know how to build reusable integrations."
- Leadership feedback: Guarantee sale became a strategic revenue driver; expansion to trade-ins and retail green-lit based on success.

**What would not have happened without this work:**
- Guarantee sales would have remained a niche, low-adoption product.
- Company revenue from guarantee sales would have been a fraction of current impact.
- Specialists would be stuck in intake work, unable to scale.
- Design team would lack a pattern for building reusable integrations.
- Expansion to trade-ins and retail would require more engineering time and design effort.

## Constraints That Shaped the Work

- **Manual process expertise:** The 3 specialists held complex pricing logic in their heads. Extracting and digitizing that logic required heavy research and validation. We couldn't just automate; we had to understand the *why* behind decisions before encoding rules.
- **Risk management:** Guarantee sales carry risk (payout guarantees must be backed by actual sales). We had to build safeguards into the pricing logic to ensure the company wasn't overcommitting. Digitization meant encoding those safeguards without dealer visibility (dealers shouldn't see that we're managing risk; they should just see fair pricing).
- **Cross-functional alignment:** Success required coordination across product, design, research, engineering, analytics, and sales. Communication was critical because guarantee sale touch points many systems and teams.
- **Team capacity:** A 12-person team working for 1 year is a big commitment. We had to prioritize ruthlessly and deliver incrementally so the company saw value and maintained commitment through the full cycle.

## What This Enabled Next

- **Immediate follow-on:** Trade-in guarantee sales and retail guarantee sales are now underway, using the white-label component system. Expected expansion to similar scale as auction guarantee sales.
- **Design system precedent:** White-label component approach is now being adopted across design teams. Any team building an integration can use the pattern established by guarantee sale.
- **Specialist team evolution:** The 3 manual specialists now focus on model validation, edge-case pricing, and risk management. Their expertise shifted from volume to strategy, improving job satisfaction and value to the company.
- **Revenue impact:** Guarantee sales went from a niche product to a material revenue driver. Expansion into trade-ins and retail compounds that impact.

## Reflection (Forward-Looking)

- **Capability unlocked:** I learned that big growth often comes from removing friction, not from building new features. Guarantee sale existed as a feature; the problem was the workflow friction around accessing it. By redesigning the workflow, we unlocked 10x adoption. This insight applies to any product integration or feature rollout.
- **How this changed my approach:** I now ask "Where is the dealer in their decision-making journey when we surface this option?" before designing workflows. Making something available isn't enough; it has to appear at the right moment in the decision process. Timing and context drive adoption far more than features or education.
- **What kinds of problems I now look for:** Underutilized products or features that have real demand but are experiencing friction in the decision or workflow. These are high-leverage problems because the fix is about redesigning the path, not rebuilding the product.
- **Leadership and team impact:** This project showed me the value of owning the full cycle—strategy, research, design, product, communication, team coordination. Being the connective tissue between teams (researcher + designer + product owner + communication lead) is where I create the most impact.
